Samples were solicited and procured through the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (now the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection).",
        "Study Protocol Description": "The RR-1 mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. Exact matched procedures were held for ground control, vivarium, and basal groups. After vehicle return, dissection of all four groups (flight, baseline, ground, vivarium) were conducted. The returned carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. The first round of carcass dissections, known as the RR1 1st thaw BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program), spanned a 2-week period in April 2015 and a 1-week period in May 2015. The RR1 2nd thaw BSP was performed in March 2016. BSP samples were dissected, frozen, and then transferred to the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA; now NBISC [NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection) for long-term storage. Tissues from forty mice were received for this study, from RR-1 through BSP/ALSDA and lumbar vertebrae (L4) were assessed for cancellous bone by microcomputed tomography. Vertebrae were preserved by wrapping specimens with single 2-ply gauze squares (1/3 of a typical tri-fold gauze pad) and dipped into PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Tissues were stored in labeled specimen containers and placed on ice, and subsequently stored at -20C.     The mCT machine used for this study was a SkyScan 1174, Bruker, Belgium. The scanning was conducted at 6.7 micrometers per pixel, x-ray intensity was 800 miliamperes, and killivolt peak was 50kvp, with frame averaging of 2. A .log file from the scanning, reconstruction, and analysis from this mCT study was submitted and available for data provenance.     This study was approved by by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Post-pubescent female C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks at launch) were exposed to 37 days of microG flight, after being flown to the ISS, and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were acclimated to NASA Rodent Food bars, lixits, and wire floors.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     An upper/lower threshold approach was used to binarize grayscale images, with a lower gray threshold of 40 and upper gray threshold of 255 (on 0-1000 scale).     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

Partially thawed samples were transferred into 15-mL conical tubes and allowed to completely thaw on ice. Bacteria cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 0 C. RNA extraction and DNase treatment were performed using the Invitrogen RiboPure-Bacteria Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The total RNA concentration was measured with Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNA quality was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).     Ribodepletion, cDNA synthesis, and library preparation were performed by Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL).     50bp paired-end reads were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500     BRIC-21 utilized four Biological Research In Canisters Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). Two BRIC_PDFUs were prepared with flight samples, and two were prepared with ground control samples. The four BRIC-PDFUs included five 60 mm Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). 1x10^7 B. subtilis spores (strain 168) were air dried onto the 20 Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). Flight samples were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-6 which launched 4/14/15. Once aboard the ISS, growth of both microbes was initiated by the addition of 8.5 mL of TSY-Glycerol media (10% glycerol (v/v), 1.7% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.3% soytone, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.25% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.25% (w/v) glucose). B. subtilis samples were grown for 25 hours at 23 C without agitation. Growth was terminated by transferring the BRIC-PDFUs to the onboard minus eighty-degree laboratory freezer for ISS (MELFI). Matching ground controls were grown asynchronously following the same procedures using identical hardware with the same ISS environmental conditions that the flight samples were exposed to. Before sample return on 5/21/15, all BRIC canisters were transferred to -32 C cold bags and maintained at this temperature until arrival at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). At KSC, BRIC-PDFUs were de-integrated and the Petri dishes containing experimental samples were then removed and stored at -80 C.",

Briefly, wipes containing the surface sample were returned to Earth and transported to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where they were then centrifuged followed by culturing using the spread plate method for isolation on R2A medium and then stored as freezer stocks at -80°C. Strain IF3SW-P1 was subcultured to late log phase in TSB at 37°C prior to DNA extraction.     Genomic DNA was extracted using the DOE Joint Genome Institute 'Bacterial genomic isolation using CTAB' protocol.     The sequencing library was constructed using Q20+EA early access ligation reagents (SQK-LSK112-XL).     Oxford Nanopore sequencing with Q20+ chemistry was performed using GridION MK1 sequencer on a FLO-MIN112 R10.4 flow cell. Raw reads were base-called using MinKNOW v29.10.8, with a mean quality score of 16.3 and mode of 18.03.     The genome was assembled and polished using Flye v2.9.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Isolates were collected from surfaces of the ISS using the Surface Sampler Kit (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Hardware/hardw/670), isolated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates, and stored at -80C in 15% glycerol. Isolates from the ISS potable water dispenser were obtained by filtering sample from both the ambient and hot water outlets of the potable water system through a microbial capture device. The device filter was then placed on R2A agar and then stored at -80C in 15% glycerol.     DNA was extracted from isolates using a phenol/chloroform protocol and quantified using a nanodrop and run on a gel to inspect quality.     Microbial-isolate DNA library preparation was performed with the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions, but using half the standard reaction volumes.      Sequencing was performed on Illumina's NextSeq 500 platform with 2x150 paired-end reads.     Adapters were searched and removed with bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17 (Illumina). Quality trimming and filtering was performed with Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) using a sliding window setting of 5:20 and filtering out reads shorter than 100 bp after trimming. Assemblies were performed using SPAdes v3.12.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) with default settings.",

Samples were collected using pre-moistened polyester from 8 surfaces on the ISS: cupola, Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC), crew quarters, Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), Overhead 4, dining table, Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) 1, and Lab 3 Overhead. Wipes were stored at 4 degrees C until return to Earth. Upon return to Earth, wipes were shaken in PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline). PBS was concentrated and plated onto R2A and PDA (25 degrees C, 7 days) and blood agar (37 degrees C, 3 days). Details of sampling locations and methods have been reported in Checinska et al, 2019 and Singh et al, 2018.",
