Samples were solicited and procured through the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (now the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection).",
        "Study Protocol Description": "The RR-1 mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. Exact matched procedures were held for ground control, vivarium, and basal groups. After vehicle return, dissection of all four groups (flight, baseline, ground, vivarium) were conducted. The returned carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. The first round of carcass dissections, known as the RR1 1st thaw BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program), spanned a 2-week period in April 2015 and a 1-week period in May 2015. The RR1 2nd thaw BSP was performed in March 2016. BSP samples were dissected, frozen, and then transferred to the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA; now NBISC [NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection) for long-term storage. Tissues from forty mice were received for this study, from RR-1 through BSP/ALSDA and lumbar vertebrae (L4) were assessed for cancellous bone by microcomputed tomography. Vertebrae were preserved by wrapping specimens with single 2-ply gauze squares (1/3 of a typical tri-fold gauze pad) and dipped into PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Tissues were stored in labeled specimen containers and placed on ice, and subsequently stored at -20C.     The mCT machine used for this study was a SkyScan 1174, Bruker, Belgium. The scanning was conducted at 6.7 micrometers per pixel, x-ray intensity was 800 miliamperes, and killivolt peak was 50kvp, with frame averaging of 2. A .log file from the scanning, reconstruction, and analysis from this mCT study was submitted and available for data provenance.     This study was approved by by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Post-pubescent female C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks at launch) were exposed to 37 days of microG flight, after being flown to the ISS, and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were acclimated to NASA Rodent Food bars, lixits, and wire floors.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     An upper/lower threshold approach was used to binarize grayscale images, with a lower gray threshold of 40 and upper gray threshold of 255 (on 0-1000 scale).     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

Partially thawed samples were transferred into 15-mL conical tubes and allowed to completely thaw on ice. Bacteria cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 0 C. RNA extraction and DNase treatment were performed using the Invitrogen RiboPure-Bacteria Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The total RNA concentration was measured with Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNA quality was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).     Ribodepletion, cDNA synthesis, and library preparation were performed by Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL).     50bp paired-end reads were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500     BRIC-21 utilized four Biological Research In Canisters Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). Two BRIC_PDFUs were prepared with flight samples, and two were prepared with ground control samples. The four BRIC-PDFUs included five 60 mm Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). 1x10^7 B. subtilis spores (strain 168) were air dried onto the 20 Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). Flight samples were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-6 which launched 4/14/15. Once aboard the ISS, growth of both microbes was initiated by the addition of 8.5 mL of TSY-Glycerol media (10% glycerol (v/v), 1.7% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.3% soytone, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.25% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.25% (w/v) glucose). B. subtilis samples were grown for 25 hours at 23 C without agitation. Growth was terminated by transferring the BRIC-PDFUs to the onboard minus eighty-degree laboratory freezer for ISS (MELFI). Matching ground controls were grown asynchronously following the same procedures using identical hardware with the same ISS environmental conditions that the flight samples were exposed to. Before sample return on 5/21/15, all BRIC canisters were transferred to -32 C cold bags and maintained at this temperature until arrival at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). At KSC, BRIC-PDFUs were de-integrated and the Petri dishes containing experimental samples were then removed and stored at -80 C.",

Briefly, wipes containing the surface sample were returned to Earth and transported to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where they were then centrifuged followed by culturing using the spread plate method for isolation on R2A medium and then stored as freezer stocks at -80°C. Strain IF3SW-P1 was subcultured to late log phase in TSB at 37°C prior to DNA extraction.     Genomic DNA was extracted using the DOE Joint Genome Institute 'Bacterial genomic isolation using CTAB' protocol.     The sequencing library was constructed using Q20+EA early access ligation reagents (SQK-LSK112-XL).     Oxford Nanopore sequencing with Q20+ chemistry was performed using GridION MK1 sequencer on a FLO-MIN112 R10.4 flow cell. Raw reads were base-called using MinKNOW v29.10.8, with a mean quality score of 16.3 and mode of 18.03.     The genome was assembled and polished using Flye v2.9.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Isolates were collected from surfaces of the ISS using the Surface Sampler Kit (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Hardware/hardw/670), isolated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates, and stored at -80C in 15% glycerol. Isolates from the ISS potable water dispenser were obtained by filtering sample from both the ambient and hot water outlets of the potable water system through a microbial capture device. The device filter was then placed on R2A agar and then stored at -80C in 15% glycerol.     DNA was extracted from isolates using a phenol/chloroform protocol and quantified using a nanodrop and run on a gel to inspect quality.     Microbial-isolate DNA library preparation was performed with the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions, but using half the standard reaction volumes.      Sequencing was performed on Illumina's NextSeq 500 platform with 2x150 paired-end reads.     Adapters were searched and removed with bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17 (Illumina). Quality trimming and filtering was performed with Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) using a sliding window setting of 5:20 and filtering out reads shorter than 100 bp after trimming. Assemblies were performed using SPAdes v3.12.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) with default settings.",

    "abstract": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and remeasured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. This dataset derives results from the intraocular pressure (tonometry) assay.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Before launch and again before the post-flight euthanization, a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC) was used to measure IOP in conscious animals. This allowed IOP to be measured accurately, rapidly and without a local anesthetic. Measurements of IOP using the rebound tonometer appeared to be well tolerated by the mice. The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Five-6 sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse. This process was repeated three times for each eye.     On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n equals 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Due to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded.     Post-flight evaluation of the mice. Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to LLU within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a intraocular pressure data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all intraocular pressure results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. This dataset derives results from the intraocular pressure (tonometry) assay.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Microbial isolates in agar stabs were provided by the Microbial Tracking 2 PI at NASA JPL and stored at 5C. A 10 microliter aliquot of the stab was diluted into 100 microliters of trypic soy broth and spread onto the surface of a tryptic soy agar petri dish. After 72 hours of growth, the plate was gently scrapped to remove the biomass and placed in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube for genomic DNA extraction.     Cell pellets resuspended in 400 microliters of 100 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl buffer at pH 7.0 were mixed with 15 microliters RNAase A and 20 microliters of lysozyme (20 mg/mL) and incubated at 58 C for 1 hour with gentle mixing by inversion every 15 minutes.\n\nTo this mixture, 10 microliters of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and 20% SDS to a final concentration of 2%, were added, gently mixed by inversion and incubated at 58C for 1 hour.\n\nThe mixture was then cooled on ice for 5 minutes and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation (10k x g for 10 minutes).\n\nThe supernatant was treated with 2x chloroform extractions and the genomic DNA was isolated from the aqueous phase via ethanol precipitation.\n\nDNA quality was assessed by fluorometric quantification (Qubit, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and UV-Vis microvolume spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All gDNA manipulation was performed using wide-bore pipet tips to prevent gDNA shearing.     Native genomic DNA (gDNA) was sequenced on a MinION R9.4 flowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). The sequencing library was prepared using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Sequencing kit (SQK-RBK004) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.     Native genomic DNA was sequenced on a MinION Mk1.B sequencing device with an R9.4.1 Flowcell using standard configuration settings. Data were output as raw fast5 files.     Sequencing Fast5 files were base-called using the ONT Guppy base-caller (v6.21) using the super high accuracy model. Genomes were assembled using Flye (v2.9.1) and polished with the ONT tool Medaka (v1.7.0, https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) using default parameters for both.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA). Briefly, each polyester wipe (9 x 9 inch; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min followed by the transfer to a sterile zip lock bag. The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. The samples were stored at room temperature in orbit. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after arrival to Earth at 4C with processing at JPL commencing within 2 h of receipt.     Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using Bertin Precelys.     This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5-12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384 plex configuration.     Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2x150 platform with a paired-end module.     The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor free reads for genome assembly(cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes genome assembler (k-mer size- 32-72 bases).",

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation is one of the most common protein modifications and plays essential roles in biology and therapeutics. However, the analysis of in vivo O-linked glycosylation, a major type of protein glycosylation, has been severely impeded by the scarcity of technology. Here, a chemoenzymatic method was presented for the site-specific extraction of O-linked glycopeptides (EXoO), which achieved simultaneous enrichment and unambiguous mapping of over 3,000 O-linked glycosylation sites and corresponding O-linked glycans on over 1,000 proteins in human kidney tissues, serum and T cells. The large-scale localization of O-linked glycosylation sites nearly doubles the sites identified in the last decades demonstrating that EXoO is the most effective method to-date for defining the site-specific O-linked glycoproteome in different types of sample.  Structural analysis of the sites revealed conserved motifs and topological orientation facing extracellular space or lumen of ER and Golgi. Striking signature of aberrant in vivo O-linked glycoproteome was observed between kidney tumor and normal tissues discovering key factors in tumor biology. The O-linked glycoproteome play diverse roles on the ER, Golgi membrane, cell surface and extracellular space arguing that EXoO can be applied broadly to the analysis of O-linked glycoproteins in biology and therapeutics.",

        "Study Description": "Protein glycosylation is one of the most common protein modifications and plays essential roles in biology and therapeutics. However, the analysis of in vivo O-linked glycosylation, a major type of protein glycosylation, has been severely impeded by the scarcity of technology. Here, a chemoenzymatic method was presented for the site-specific extraction of O-linked glycopeptides (EXoO), which achieved simultaneous enrichment and unambiguous mapping of over 3,000 O-linked glycosylation sites and corresponding O-linked glycans on over 1,000 proteins in human kidney tissues, serum and T cells. The large-scale localization of O-linked glycosylation sites nearly doubles the sites identified in the last decades demonstrating that EXoO is the most effective method to-date for defining the site-specific O-linked glycoproteome in different types of sample.  Structural analysis of the sites revealed conserved motifs and topological orientation facing extracellular space or lumen of ER and Golgi. Striking signature of aberrant in vivo O-linked glycoproteome was observed between kidney tumor and normal tissues discovering key factors in tumor biology. The O-linked glycoproteome play diverse roles on the ER, Golgi membrane, cell surface and extracellular space arguing that EXoO can be applied broadly to the analysis of O-linked glycoproteins in biology and therapeutics.",

The plates were incubated at 25C for 7 days. The single colony obtained was re-streaked on R2A plates, incubated at 25C for 3 days. A biomass of approximately 1 ug wet weight was collected for each strain and pooled for DNA extraction.     Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using Bertin Precelys. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07.     The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5-12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384 plex configuration.     Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2x150 platform with a paired-end module.     The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (12) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 genome assembler (k-mer size- 32-72 bases).",

The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch.

        "Study Protocol Description": "A biomass of approximately 1 ug wet weight was collected for each strain and pooled for DNA extraction. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out by lysing the cells using Bertin Precelys bead-beater followed by DNA extraction using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA).     DNA library was prepared using Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5-12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384 plex configuration.     Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2x150 platform with a paired-end module.     The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 genome assembler (k-mer size- 32-72 bases). Default parameters were used for all the software except where otherwise noted.     Briefly, samples collected from the ISS were processed, 100 ul of each dilution was plated on Reasoner's 2A agar (R2A) and incubated at 25C for 7 days. The single colony obtained was re-streaked on R2A plates and incubated at 25C for 3 days.",

Initial analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 11 Bacillus isolates (two from Kibo Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) four from US Segment Harmony Node 2 and five from Russian Segment Zvezda module sites) all belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group. Isolates were further characterized by whole genome comparative analysis. Each isolate was sequenced assembled and aligned against all members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 - 5.3 Mbp) strain nucleotide identity (>99.99%) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement all isolates were found to exhibit a very high level of similarity. With respect to gene content all isolates were inspected for cry proteins common to B. thuringiensis as well as toxins specific to B. cereus. No significant hits were found to any known cry genes while full-length matches were found for multiple B. cereus toxin genes. Finally the isolates were closely screened against B. anthracis genomes and no B. anthracis signatures were identified. Notably all isolates contained the plcR ancestral C allele and lacked significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and toxins. The collective results from the analysis confirm that these strains belong to a previously uncharacterized Bacillus species hereafter referred to as Bacillus issensis.

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of flights on suborbital rockets creates new avenues for the study of spaceflight effects on biological systems, in particular the transitions between hypergravity and microgravity. This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3κ:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3κ:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Petri dishes (100 mm x 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5x Murashige-Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1x Gamborg's Vitamin Mixture, were prepared aseptically for planting. Seeds were sterilized via treatment with 70% ethanol for 10 minutes, and then with 50% bleach supplemented with Tween-20 at 2-3 drops per mL for 20 minutes, with seeds being mixed throughout the process. Seeds were washed with sterile water at least 6 times, and stored at 4 C for 3-5 days. Seeds were dispensed onto the media surface in a laminar flow hood in one row of 12-15 seeds, and plates were sealed with Micropore tape (3M, Maplewood, MN, USA). Plates were grown vertically at the University of florida in growth rooms at 19 +/-- 2 C, and 24-h fluorescent lighting at approximately 80 umol m-2 s-1 PAR until the time of transport to the experimental location. Plates were transported to Ellington Airport in Houston, Texas, inside a cooler lit with an LED light bank, and maintained onsite in a mobile growth setup consisting of a fluorescent light bank, with room temperature similar to that used for early growth.     The morning before the flight, seedlings were transplanted from plates into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) loaded with RNALater fixative internally fitted with wetted Kimwipes cut into a cylinder. On the flight day, KFTs were taken onboard the C-9 aircraft. Members of the group actuated the KFTs in level flight before the first parabola, and after the first, third, and tenth parabolas, fixing seedlings in RNALater     Samples were stored at 4 C, and transported on ice back to UF, where they were stored at -80 C. Samples were later removed from -80 C, and seedling roots were dissected from shoot tissues. Roots were grouped into 3-4 replicates per condition, and total RNA was extracted from roots and submitted for microarray analysis. The Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Gene (AraGene) 1.0 ST array was used to measure gene expression levels.     RNALater-fixed samples were removed from -80 C storage, and thawed overnight at 4 C. Seedlings were disentangled, and roots were dissected from shoots. Root tissues were used for RNA extraction, and shoots were restored to -80 C storage. For each experimental condition, 3-4 biological replicates, derived from roots fixed in a single KFT, were used. Excess RNALater was removed from roots, and RNA was extracted using the QIAshredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA), using the manufacturer's instructions. RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used for on-column digestion and removal of DNA     cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA, and the cDNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription (IVT). The antisense RNA synthesized during the IVT reaction was used to generate sense DNA. Sense strand DNA was fragmented, biotin-labeled using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog   900670) per the manufacturer's protocol.     3.5 ug of sense DNA was hybridized, with rotation, onto an Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Gene 1.0 ST Array for 16 h at 45 C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog   00-0079) using the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Thermofisher Scientific, Catalog   900720) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0002.     KFTs were actuated in level flight before the onset of parabolic flight, and after the first, third, and tenth parabolas. Samples were stored at 4 C, and transported on ice back to UF, where they were stored at -80 C. Samples were later removed from -80 °C, and seedling roots were dissected from shoot tissues. Roots were grouped into 3-4 replicates per condition, and total RNA was extracted from roots and submitted for microarray analysis. The Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Gene (AraGene) 1.0 ST array was used to measure gene expression levels. The transcriptomic data from the samples fixed in parabolic flight were then compared to those fixed during level flight in order to identify differentially-expressed genes associated with parabolic flight patterns.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.1 (GitHub link coming soon).  In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.2). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0).  Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using the Plants Ensembl database ftp server (plants.ensembl.org, release 54). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

Seedlings were transplanted from plates into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) loaded with RNAlater fixative internally fitted with wetted Kimwipes cut into a cylinder. KFTs were either inserted into pockets of the flight suit of the team member performing the in-flight fixation, or held by a member of the team on the ground. The flight profile consisted of a high-speed take-off, acceleration to supersonic speeds at level flight and low-altitude, then a 90 degree upward climb at 4g for roughly 30 seconds. An inversion of the plane at the peak of the climb created about ten seconds of microgravity during the following descent, and a brief period of hyper-g during the pull-up. One ground control KFT was actuated during the flight, and the two in-flight KFTs were actuated immediately after the microgravity exposure and after level flight had been maintained for about a minute and a half after the parabola.     RNAlater-fixed samples were removed from -80 C storage, and thawed overnight at 4 C. Seedlings were disentangled, and roots were dissected from shoots. Root tissues were used for RNA extraction, and shoots were restored to -80 C storage.
