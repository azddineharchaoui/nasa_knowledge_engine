Samples were solicited and procured through the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (now the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection).",
        "Study Protocol Description": "The RR-1 mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. Exact matched procedures were held for ground control, vivarium, and basal groups. After vehicle return, dissection of all four groups (flight, baseline, ground, vivarium) were conducted. The returned carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. The first round of carcass dissections, known as the RR1 1st thaw BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program), spanned a 2-week period in April 2015 and a 1-week period in May 2015. The RR1 2nd thaw BSP was performed in March 2016. BSP samples were dissected, frozen, and then transferred to the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA; now NBISC [NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection) for long-term storage. Tissues from forty mice were received for this study, from RR-1 through BSP/ALSDA and lumbar vertebrae (L4) were assessed for cancellous bone by microcomputed tomography. Vertebrae were preserved by wrapping specimens with single 2-ply gauze squares (1/3 of a typical tri-fold gauze pad) and dipped into PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Tissues were stored in labeled specimen containers and placed on ice, and subsequently stored at -20C.     The mCT machine used for this study was a SkyScan 1174, Bruker, Belgium. The scanning was conducted at 6.7 micrometers per pixel, x-ray intensity was 800 miliamperes, and killivolt peak was 50kvp, with frame averaging of 2. A .log file from the scanning, reconstruction, and analysis from this mCT study was submitted and available for data provenance.     This study was approved by by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Post-pubescent female C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks at launch) were exposed to 37 days of microG flight, after being flown to the ISS, and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were acclimated to NASA Rodent Food bars, lixits, and wire floors.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     An upper/lower threshold approach was used to binarize grayscale images, with a lower gray threshold of 40 and upper gray threshold of 255 (on 0-1000 scale).     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

Partially thawed samples were transferred into 15-mL conical tubes and allowed to completely thaw on ice. Bacteria cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 0 C. RNA extraction and DNase treatment were performed using the Invitrogen RiboPure-Bacteria Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The total RNA concentration was measured with Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNA quality was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).     Ribodepletion, cDNA synthesis, and library preparation were performed by Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL).     50bp paired-end reads were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500     BRIC-21 utilized four Biological Research In Canisters Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). Two BRIC_PDFUs were prepared with flight samples, and two were prepared with ground control samples. The four BRIC-PDFUs included five 60 mm Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). 1x10^7 B. subtilis spores (strain 168) were air dried onto the 20 Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). Flight samples were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-6 which launched 4/14/15. Once aboard the ISS, growth of both microbes was initiated by the addition of 8.5 mL of TSY-Glycerol media (10% glycerol (v/v), 1.7% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.3% soytone, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.25% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.25% (w/v) glucose). B. subtilis samples were grown for 25 hours at 23 C without agitation. Growth was terminated by transferring the BRIC-PDFUs to the onboard minus eighty-degree laboratory freezer for ISS (MELFI). Matching ground controls were grown asynchronously following the same procedures using identical hardware with the same ISS environmental conditions that the flight samples were exposed to. Before sample return on 5/21/15, all BRIC canisters were transferred to -32 C cold bags and maintained at this temperature until arrival at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). At KSC, BRIC-PDFUs were de-integrated and the Petri dishes containing experimental samples were then removed and stored at -80 C.",

Briefly, wipes containing the surface sample were returned to Earth and transported to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where they were then centrifuged followed by culturing using the spread plate method for isolation on R2A medium and then stored as freezer stocks at -80°C. Strain IF3SW-P1 was subcultured to late log phase in TSB at 37°C prior to DNA extraction.     Genomic DNA was extracted using the DOE Joint Genome Institute 'Bacterial genomic isolation using CTAB' protocol.     The sequencing library was constructed using Q20+EA early access ligation reagents (SQK-LSK112-XL).     Oxford Nanopore sequencing with Q20+ chemistry was performed using GridION MK1 sequencer on a FLO-MIN112 R10.4 flow cell. Raw reads were base-called using MinKNOW v29.10.8, with a mean quality score of 16.3 and mode of 18.03.     The genome was assembled and polished using Flye v2.9.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Isolates were collected from surfaces of the ISS using the Surface Sampler Kit (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Hardware/hardw/670), isolated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates, and stored at -80C in 15% glycerol. Isolates from the ISS potable water dispenser were obtained by filtering sample from both the ambient and hot water outlets of the potable water system through a microbial capture device. The device filter was then placed on R2A agar and then stored at -80C in 15% glycerol.     DNA was extracted from isolates using a phenol/chloroform protocol and quantified using a nanodrop and run on a gel to inspect quality.     Microbial-isolate DNA library preparation was performed with the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions, but using half the standard reaction volumes.      Sequencing was performed on Illumina's NextSeq 500 platform with 2x150 paired-end reads.     Adapters were searched and removed with bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17 (Illumina). Quality trimming and filtering was performed with Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) using a sliding window setting of 5:20 and filtering out reads shorter than 100 bp after trimming. Assemblies were performed using SPAdes v3.12.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) with default settings.",

    "abstract": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and remeasured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. This dataset derives results from the intraocular pressure (tonometry) assay.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Before launch and again before the post-flight euthanization, a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC) was used to measure IOP in conscious animals. This allowed IOP to be measured accurately, rapidly and without a local anesthetic. Measurements of IOP using the rebound tonometer appeared to be well tolerated by the mice. The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Five-6 sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse. This process was repeated three times for each eye.     On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n equals 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Due to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded.     Post-flight evaluation of the mice. Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to LLU within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a intraocular pressure data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all intraocular pressure results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. This dataset derives results from the intraocular pressure (tonometry) assay.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Microbial isolates in agar stabs were provided by the Microbial Tracking 2 PI at NASA JPL and stored at 5C. A 10 microliter aliquot of the stab was diluted into 100 microliters of trypic soy broth and spread onto the surface of a tryptic soy agar petri dish. After 72 hours of growth, the plate was gently scrapped to remove the biomass and placed in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube for genomic DNA extraction.     Cell pellets resuspended in 400 microliters of 100 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl buffer at pH 7.0 were mixed with 15 microliters RNAase A and 20 microliters of lysozyme (20 mg/mL) and incubated at 58 C for 1 hour with gentle mixing by inversion every 15 minutes.\n\nTo this mixture, 10 microliters of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and 20% SDS to a final concentration of 2%, were added, gently mixed by inversion and incubated at 58C for 1 hour.\n\nThe mixture was then cooled on ice for 5 minutes and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation (10k x g for 10 minutes).\n\nThe supernatant was treated with 2x chloroform extractions and the genomic DNA was isolated from the aqueous phase via ethanol precipitation.\n\nDNA quality was assessed by fluorometric quantification (Qubit, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and UV-Vis microvolume spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All gDNA manipulation was performed using wide-bore pipet tips to prevent gDNA shearing.     Native genomic DNA (gDNA) was sequenced on a MinION R9.4 flowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). The sequencing library was prepared using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Sequencing kit (SQK-RBK004) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.     Native genomic DNA was sequenced on a MinION Mk1.B sequencing device with an R9.4.1 Flowcell using standard configuration settings. Data were output as raw fast5 files.     Sequencing Fast5 files were base-called using the ONT Guppy base-caller (v6.21) using the super high accuracy model. Genomes were assembled using Flye (v2.9.1) and polished with the ONT tool Medaka (v1.7.0, https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) using default parameters for both.",

        "Study Protocol Description": "Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA). Briefly, each polyester wipe (9 x 9 inch; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min followed by the transfer to a sterile zip lock bag. The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. The samples were stored at room temperature in orbit. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after arrival to Earth at 4C with processing at JPL commencing within 2 h of receipt.     Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using Bertin Precelys.     This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5-12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384 plex configuration.     Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2x150 platform with a paired-end module.     The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor free reads for genome assembly(cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes genome assembler (k-mer size- 32-72 bases).",

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation is one of the most common protein modifications and plays essential roles in biology and therapeutics. However, the analysis of in vivo O-linked glycosylation, a major type of protein glycosylation, has been severely impeded by the scarcity of technology. Here, a chemoenzymatic method was presented for the site-specific extraction of O-linked glycopeptides (EXoO), which achieved simultaneous enrichment and unambiguous mapping of over 3,000 O-linked glycosylation sites and corresponding O-linked glycans on over 1,000 proteins in human kidney tissues, serum and T cells. The large-scale localization of O-linked glycosylation sites nearly doubles the sites identified in the last decades demonstrating that EXoO is the most effective method to-date for defining the site-specific O-linked glycoproteome in different types of sample.  Structural analysis of the sites revealed conserved motifs and topological orientation facing extracellular space or lumen of ER and Golgi. Striking signature of aberrant in vivo O-linked glycoproteome was observed between kidney tumor and normal tissues discovering key factors in tumor biology. The O-linked glycoproteome play diverse roles on the ER, Golgi membrane, cell surface and extracellular space arguing that EXoO can be applied broadly to the analysis of O-linked glycoproteins in biology and therapeutics.",

        "Study Description": "Protein glycosylation is one of the most common protein modifications and plays essential roles in biology and therapeutics. However, the analysis of in vivo O-linked glycosylation, a major type of protein glycosylation, has been severely impeded by the scarcity of technology. Here, a chemoenzymatic method was presented for the site-specific extraction of O-linked glycopeptides (EXoO), which achieved simultaneous enrichment and unambiguous mapping of over 3,000 O-linked glycosylation sites and corresponding O-linked glycans on over 1,000 proteins in human kidney tissues, serum and T cells. The large-scale localization of O-linked glycosylation sites nearly doubles the sites identified in the last decades demonstrating that EXoO is the most effective method to-date for defining the site-specific O-linked glycoproteome in different types of sample.  Structural analysis of the sites revealed conserved motifs and topological orientation facing extracellular space or lumen of ER and Golgi. Striking signature of aberrant in vivo O-linked glycoproteome was observed between kidney tumor and normal tissues discovering key factors in tumor biology. The O-linked glycoproteome play diverse roles on the ER, Golgi membrane, cell surface and extracellular space arguing that EXoO can be applied broadly to the analysis of O-linked glycoproteins in biology and therapeutics.",

The plates were incubated at 25C for 7 days. The single colony obtained was re-streaked on R2A plates, incubated at 25C for 3 days. A biomass of approximately 1 ug wet weight was collected for each strain and pooled for DNA extraction.     Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using Bertin Precelys. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07.     The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5-12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384 plex configuration.     Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2x150 platform with a paired-end module.     The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (12) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 genome assembler (k-mer size- 32-72 bases).",

The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch.
