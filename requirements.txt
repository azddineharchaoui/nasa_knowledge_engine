# =================================================================================
# POST-INSTALLATION SETUP REQUIRED:
# =================================================================================
# After installing requirements, run these commands:
# 
# 1. Download spaCy language model (REQUIRED for knowledge graph functionality):
#    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
#
# 2. Download NLTK data (handled automatically by the application):
#    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
#
# 3. Verify installation:
#    python -c "import spacy; nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm'); print('spaCy model loaded successfully')"
# =================================================================================
